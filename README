# GUGA CHESS

Attempting to develop a chess client with my dad for my son :)

## High-level overview

This should probably consist of a few things:
* A chess engine (game object, taking moves, computing states)
* Some sort of web client (probably using continuation tokens to simplify auth)
* Some GUI to use it offline.
